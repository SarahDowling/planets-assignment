<h2>Introduction</h2>

A planet is a celestial body, orbiting a star, that is massive enough to be gravitationally rounded and has “cleared the neighbourhood” around its orbit.
“I think of space not as the final frontier but as the next frontier.” — Neil Degrasse Tyson
Unfortunately, Pluto is no longer a planet but a dwarf planet. Sometimes I think, Pluto still deserves full planet hood.
